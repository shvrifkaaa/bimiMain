                                                    university is
                                                    a means to master the professional language of medical terminology.
                                                    Therefore, the focus of the course is the term, its structure and
                                                    meaning. Therefore, knowledge of the Latin language for a physician
                                                    makes it possible to understand the terminology of other, related
                                                    sciences. Learning Latin improves the lexical stock of the physician
                                                    and facilitates the process of memorizing new words of foreign
                                                    origin. Latin in medicine is traditionally used as the international
                                                    terminology of anatomy and pharmacology, as well as in the

                                                    the basic concepts of medical practice, generally accepted in
                                                    medical practice; play the role of a system-forming factor in the
                                                    formation of medical terminology. The Latin language is most
                                                    directly connected with all disciplines studied at the faculty,

                                                    pharmacology, clinical disciplines. The study of the discipline
                                                    allows laying the foundations of terminological training of future
                                                    specialists, teaching students to consciously and competently apply
                                                    medical terms in Latin when studying medical disciplines, as well as
                                                    competently use terms of Greek-Latin origin in English and Russian
                                                    in their practical and scientific activities. Upon completion of the
                                                    course of study, students develop practical skills that allow them
                                                    to successfully overcome the terminological difficulties of

                                                    with the approved working curriculum of the state component, the
                                                    humanitarian and social cycle. Philosophy views the world through
                                                    the prism of a truly human attitude to it, lays the foundations of a
                                                    humanistic worldview. It contributes to the self-determination of a
                                                    person in the world, the constructive solution of the most important
                                                    meaning-life issues, the development of an effective life strategy.
                                                    Philosophy develops a general theoretical picture of the
                                                    relationship between man and the world, reveals the deep foundations
                                                    of culture. Philosophy together with psychology indicate the ways of
                                                    mastering the cultural content of the emerging personality, which is
                                                    necessary for entering an independent life and fruitful
                                                    self-realization. The study of the discipline allows you to form the
                                                    scientific foundations of a professional understanding of the
                                                    subject area of philosophy. In the process of education, it is
                                                    necessary to arm oneself with philosophical knowledge in order to
                                                    subsequently be able to independently understand complex
                                                    philosophical issues and issues of life in general. A certain level
                                                    of philosophical knowledge will give you the opportunity to think
                                                    independently and creatively, and also allows you to correctly
                                                    evaluate various philosophical religious views, to distinguish
                                                    serious teachings from outright charlatanism. All this involves the
                                                    development of skills and abilities to apply philosophy as a
                                                    methodological basis for solving a variety of cognitive, research
                                                    and practical tasks that future medical specialists will meet in
                                                    their lives. The study of philosophy forms the foundation of the
                                                    general cultural and general theoretical and humanitarian training

                                                    extensive field of knowledge, the foundation of many biomedical
                                                    disciplines and, first of all, biochemistry, molecular biology,
                                                    immunology and pharmacology. The study is based on a systematic
                                                    approach to the construction of the entire course on a single
                                                    theoretical basis based on the concepts of the electronic and
                                                    spatial structure of organic compounds and the mechanisms of their
                                                    chemical transformations. The material is presented in the form of
                                                    the following sections, the most important of which are:
                                                    "Fundamentals of the structure and reactivity of mono-, poly- and
                                                    heterofunctional organic compounds", "Biopolymers and their
                                                    structural components. Bioregulators". The program is aimed at
                                                    specialized teaching of chemistry at a medical university, in
                                                    connection with which the discipline can be called "chemistry in
                                                    medicine". Profilization of chemistry teaching is the consideration
                                                    of the historical relationship between the development of medicine

                                                    disciplines. It is the science of the form, structure, origin and
                                                    development of the human body, its systems and organs. Anatomy
                                                    studies the human structure taking into account biological patterns,

                                                    disciplines. It is the science of the form, structure, origin and
                                                    development of the human body, its systems and organs. Anatomy
                                                    studies the human structure taking into account biological patterns,
                                                    age, gender and individual characteristics. Basic methods of
                                                    anatomy: observation, examination of the body, autopsy, study of an
                                                    individual organ or group of organs, their internal structure.
                                                    Modern anatomy is functional because it considers the structure of
                                                    the human body in connection with its functions. Anatomy is most

                                                    clinical disciplines. The subject of study of the discipline
                                                    "Microbiology, virology" are pathogenic biological agents (PBAs) –
                                                    microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), genetically
                                                    engineered microorganisms, poisons of biological origin (toxins),
                                                    helminths that cause diseases in humans. The basic biological
                                                    properties of pathogens, their interaction with the macroorganism
                                                    and the environment, the mechanisms of protection of the human body
                                                    are studied. Currently, microorganisms represent by number the most
                                                    significant and most diverse part of the organisms inhabiting the
                                                    Earth's biosphere. This served as the basis for the division of all
                                                    microorganisms into 4 large kingdoms: bacteria, fungi, protozoa and
                                                    viruses. Each of them is the object of study of separate sections of

                                                    protozoology and virology. During the development of microbiology,
                                                    original research methods were developed, many borrowed from other

                                                    clinical disciplines. The subject of study of the discipline
                                                    "Microbiology, virology" are pathogenic biological agents (PBAs) –
                                                    microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), genetically
                                                    engineered microorganisms, poisons of biological origin (toxins),
                                                    helminths that cause diseases in humans. The basic biological
                                                    properties of pathogens, their interaction with the macroorganism
                                                    and the environment, the mechanisms of protection of the human body
                                                    are studied. Currently, microorganisms represent by number the most
                                                    significant and most diverse part of the organisms inhabiting the
                                                    Earth's biosphere. This served as the basis for the division of all
                                                    microorganisms into 4 large kingdoms: bacteria, fungi, protozoa and
                                                    viruses. Each of them is the object of study of separate sections of
                                                    microbiology, independent disciplines — bacteriology, mycology,
                                                    protozoology and virology. During the development of microbiology,
                                                    original research methods were developed, many borrowed from other
                                                    disciplines — biophysics, biochemistry, genetics, cytology, etc. The
                                                    task of studying "Microbiology, virology and immunology" is to

                                                    clinical disciplines. The subject of study of the discipline
                                                    "Microbiology, virology" are pathogenic biological agents (PBAs) –
                                                    microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa), genetically

                                                    helminths that cause diseases in humans. The basic biological
                                                    properties of pathogens, their interaction with the macroorganism
                                                    and the environment, the mechanisms of protection of the human body
                                                    are studied. Currently, microorganisms represent by number the most

                                                    protozoology and virology. During the development of microbiology,
                                                    original research methods were developed, many borrowed from other
